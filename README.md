# CertCity

CertCity is a node.js API and web application for managing large amounts of AWS ACM certificates. If you manage a large amount of ACM certificates, you have probably noticed that the ACM Console interface can no longer suit your needs. Until it can, CertCity aims to make management of ACM certificates via API or UI much easier and more functional.
